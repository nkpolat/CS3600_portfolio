         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <img src="main.jpg" alt="Nihat Kayra Polat" width="200" style="border-radius: 50%">
         <p>I was born in August 27, 2002 in Hoboken, New Jersey to a turkish family who was trying to make a living for themselves. Very shortly after my birth, my parents decided it was time to go back to Istanbul, Turkiye, where I was raised for 13 years. Then, for a long time, my dad wanted to come back to the states. On September 7, 2016, we moved back in the United States.</p>
         <p>This time, however, we moved to Lynnwood, Washington, and have been living there ever since. In 2020, during peak covid year, I started at the University of Idaho fully remote (so that year does not count). Now, I am a senior in computer science. Some things I love are greek mythology, history, video games, and most importantly, sports.</p>
